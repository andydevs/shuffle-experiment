# Shuffle Experiment

## Overview

One of the components of computer science is figuring out how to sort an array of numbers in the quickest, most efficient way possible.

I intend to do the opposite, figuring out how to shuffle an array of numbers such that the numbers are the most randomly distributed as possible.

I've created an algorithm that takes two random inceces in the array and swaps them, what I call a shuffle.

This is an experiment to determine how many times a sorted array of arbitrary length must be shuffled to produce the maximum "randomness" in the array.

## Usage
### Note
This program has only been compiled for a 64-bit Unix system. So, if you have a 64-bit computer running Mac OS or Linux, you can run "bin/shuffle_experiment". 

### Using MATLAB code
Run shuffle_experiment_analysis.m in the analysis folder. This will read the data and options and plot three graphs of the data.
