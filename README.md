This is an experiment to determine how many times a sorted array of arbitrary length must be shuffled (two random numbers in the array swapped) to produce the maximum disorder in the array.

# Shuffle Experiment

One of the components of computer science is figuring out how to sort an array of numbers in the quickest, most efficient way possible.

I intend to do the opposite, figuring out how to shuffle an array of numbers such that the numbers are the most randomly distributed as possible.

I've created an algorithm that takes two random inceces in the array and swaps them, what I call a shuffle.

This is an experiment to determine how many times a sorted array of arbitrary length must be shuffled to produce the maximum "randomness" in the array.

Since this isn't a release-bound project, I haven't included a license.
